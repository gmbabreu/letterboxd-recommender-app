# Letterboxd Recommender App
In this repository you can find the code for the letterboxd recommender website. It recommends movies based on the user's letterboxd profile, by scraping their ratings and evaluating their tastes. All you have to do is your Letterboxd username and it will provide recommendations. If you do not have a letterboxd account, you can also get movie recommendations from my other repository "movie recommender".

The recommender uses publicly available movie rating data from letterboxd. It performs matrix factorization to condense those ratings and their features into the movies_factor.csv file, from which it bases its recommendations when a user inputs his own movie ratings
